      type: string
      description: >
        A unique identifier of the connection.
    
    - name: id
      type: conn_id
      description: >
        The connection's 4-tuple of endpoint addresses/ports.
    
    - name: proto
      type: transport_proto
      description: >
        The transport layer protocol of the connection.
    
    - name: service
      type: string

the connection.
    
    - name: duration
      type: interval
      description: >
        How long the connection lasted.  For 3-way or 4-way connection
tear-downs, this will not include the final ACK.
    
    - name: orig_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        The number of payload bytes the originator sent. For TCP
this is taken from sequence numbers and might be inaccurate
(e.g., due to large connections).
    
    - name: resp_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        The number of payload bytes the responder sent. See
orig_bytes.

    - name: local_orig
      type: bool
      description: >
        If the connection is originated locally, this value will be T.
If it was originated remotely it will be F.  In the case that
the Site::local_nets variable is undefined, this
field will be left empty at all times.
    
    - name: local_resp
      type: bool
      description: >
        If the connection is responded to locally, this value will be T.
If it was responded to remotely it will be F.  In the case that

    - name: missed_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        Indicates the number of bytes missed in content gaps, which
is representative of packet loss.  A value other than zero
will normally cause protocol analysis to fail but some
analysis may have been completed prior to the packet loss.
    
    - name: history
      type: string
      description: >
        Records the state history of connections as a string of
letters.  The meaning of those letters is:

    - name: orig_ip_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        Number of IP level bytes that the originator sent (as seen on
the wire, taken from the IP total_length header field).
Only set if use_conn_size_analyzer = T.
    
    - name: resp_pkts

        If this connection was over a tunnel, indicate the
uid values for any encapsulating parent connections
used over the lifetime of this inner connection.
