  fields:
    - name: ts
      type: time
      description: >
        This is the time of the first packet.
    - name: uid
      type: string
      description: >
        A unique identifier of the connection.
    - name: id
      type: conn_id
      description: >
        The connections 4-tuple of endpoint addresses/ports.
    - name: proto
      type: transport_proto
      description: >
        The transport layer protocol of the connection.
    - name: service
      type: string
      description: >
        An identification of an application protocol being sent over the connection.
    - name: duration
      type: interval
      description: >
        How long the connection lasted.  For 3-way or 4-way connection tear-downs, this will not include the final ACK.
    - name: orig_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        The number of payload bytes the originator sent. For TCP this is taken from sequence numbers and might be inaccurate (e.g., due to large connections).
    - name: resp_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        The number of payload bytes the responder sent. See orig_bytes.
    - name: conn_state
      type: string

    - name: local_orig
      type: bool
      description: >
        If the connection is originated locally, this value will be T. If it was originated remotely it will be F.  In the case that the Site::local_nets variable is undefined, this field will be left empty at all times.
    - name: local_resp
      type: bool
      description: >
        If the connection is responded to locally, this value will be T. If it was responded to remotely it will be F.  In the case that the Site::local_nets variable is undefined, this field will be left empty at all times.
    - name: missed_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        Indicates the number of bytes missed in content gaps, which is representative of packet loss.  A value other than zero will normally cause protocol analysis to fail but some analysis may have been completed prior to the packet loss.
    - name: history
      type: string
      description: >
        Records the state history of connections as a string of letters.  The meaning of those letters is:
    - name: orig_pkts
      type: count
      description: >
        Number of packets that the originator sent. Only set if use_conn_size_analyzer = T.
    - name: orig_ip_bytes
      type: count
      description: >
        Number of IP level bytes that the originator sent (as seen on the wire, taken from the IP total_length header field). Only set if use_conn_size_analyzer = T.
    - name: resp_pkts
      type: count
      description: >
        Number of packets that the responder sent. Only set if use_conn_size_analyzer = T.
