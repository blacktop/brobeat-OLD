        This can indicate that this software being detected should
definitely be sent onward to the logging framework.  By
default, only software that is interesting due to a change
in version or it being currently unknown is sent to the
logging framework.  This can be set to T to force the record
to be sent to the logging framework if some amount of this
tracking needs to happen in a specific way to the software.
